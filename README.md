# PlatformX

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Project Overview

This monorepo contains multiple applications and libraries:

- **User Experience App (NextJS):** Located in `apps/user-experience/`
- **Authoring App (React):** Located in `apps/authoring/`
- **MFEs (Micro Frontends):** Located in `mfe/`
- **Prelems Library (React, TypeScript):** Located in `libs/prelems-library/`
- **Utility Library (TypeScript):** Located in `libs/utility-library/`

## Getting Started

To start the development server, run the following command:

bash
nx serve platformx

`

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). Happy coding!

## Code Generation

If you use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with them. Run the following commands to explore available plugins and generators:

bash
nx list # Get a list of available plugins
nx list <plugin-name> # See what generators are available for a specific plugin

Learn more about [Nx generators in the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running Tasks

To execute tasks with Nx, use the following syntax:

bash
nx <target> <project> <...options>

You can also run multiple targets or filter specific projects:

bash
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Better Editor Integration

For better editor integration, consider using the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ, and comes with an LSP for Vim users.

## Deployment

To build the application for deployment, run:

bash
nx build authoring

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## CI/CD Setup

Nx comes with local caching built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI, you might want to go a step further:

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more about setting up CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)
